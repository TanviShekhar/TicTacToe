# TicTacToe

Created a web application using WebGL and Unity, which was hosted on GitHub Pages. 
It employs the Minimax algorithm paired with Alpha Beta Pruning to build an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game powered by AI. It offers an option to vary the difficulty level from Easy to Unbeatbable - Easy, Medium, Difficult & Unbeatable.
